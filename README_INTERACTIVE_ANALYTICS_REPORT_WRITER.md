## Getting Started

This project builds directly on our existing `instant_dashboard/` agent system. Given the infrastructure complexity, we should start with **Phase 1A: Backend Infrastructure Foundation** to establish the core platform capabilities before building the AI agents.

**Recommended First Steps**:
1. Set up multi-tenant PostgreSQL database schema
2. Implement basic user authentication and workspace management
3. Build document CRUD operations with version control
4. Create simple real-time collaboration proof-of-concept
5. Then proceed to AI agent development (Phase 1B)
